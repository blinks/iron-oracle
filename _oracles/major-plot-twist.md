Use this oracle to introduce a narrative surprise or revelation. Most of these
results have a negative implication, and can be used to resolve a match at a
crucial moment in your story. In particular, this is an effective tool to leverage
when you make a move with matched 10â€™s on the challenge dice.

This oracle offers similar results to the *Pay the Price* table (page 105), but is
more focused on dramatic events tied to your current quests.
