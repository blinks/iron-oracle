Have a change you'd like to see / make? The code is at <https://github.com/blinks/iron-oracle> -- each oracle is just a markdown list under the `_oracles` subdirectory.

## How to Use the Tables

- Ask your question and choose an appropriate oracle table.
- Click the "Roll" button, and the oracle will reveal its answer.
- Consider the *bold* answer in the context of your question and the current situation. Is the result a good fit? Does it trigger a spark of inspiration?
- If the answer is difficult to interpret for your situation, you can check up or down one row at the *grey* answers.
- If you’ve got your answer, you’re all set! Play to see what happens. If you want further detail, you can talk it out with other players or roll on another oracle table.
- If you’re having trouble, you can roll again, try a different table, or just fall back to your instincts and decide what happens next.
